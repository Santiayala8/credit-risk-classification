# Credit-Risk-Classification

# Overview

- To analyze a dataset of historical lending activity of a company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers
- The dataset reflected the following financial information: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio , number of accounts, derogatory marks and the total debt of each loan application.
- The process of the ML to analyse : Pre-processing, training, validating and evaluate the model

# Results

 - Logistic Regression Model 1:

Precision: 93% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 87% precise in predicting high-risk loans)

Accuracy: 94%

Recall: 95% (an average--the model had 100% recall in predicting low-risk loans, but 89% recall in predicting high-risk loans)

 - Logistic Regression Model 2:

Precision: 93% (an average--in predicting low-risk loans, the model was 100% precise, though the model was only 87% precise in predicting high-risk loans)

Accuracy: 100%

Recall: 100%
